# P2P.ORG Unified API Staking Showcase

This repository provides a reference implementation demonstrating how crypto intermediaries (exchanges, wallets, and custodians) can integrate P2P.ORG's Unified API to offer staking, unstaking, and withdrawal functionalities to their end-users.

## Overview

The P2P.ORG Unified API Staking Showcase is a functional demonstration of integrating P2P.ORG's Unified API, allowing users to:

- Perform staking operations across multiple blockchain networks
- Execute unstaking transactions

All API interactions are handled through a internal proxy layer that manages authentication and abstracts direct API calls.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn
- A P2P.ORG API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

cd p2p-unified-api-demo-example-1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` with your specific configuration:

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

- **API Proxy**: Next.js API routes

## üíº Business Advantages of the P2P.ORG Unified API

### Simplified Integration

The P2P.ORG Unified API provides a single integration point for staking operations across 10+ leading networks, including ETH, SOL, BTC (Babylon), TON, DOT, KSM, AVAIL, ATOM, TIA, and MATIC.

### Significant Development Resource Savings

- Integration time can be reduced significantly compared to individual network integrations
- Unified operational flow for staking, unstaking, and withdrawing across all supported networks

### Future-Ready Scalability

- The API is designed to accommodate both existing and future networks
- Adding support for new blockchains requires only updating network parameters
- Long-term flexibility without additional integrations as new networks emerge

## üîç Project Structure

The application uses Next.js App Router architecture:

```
/api                # API Proxy Routes
/app                # Next.js App Router
/components         # UI Components
/config             # Configuration files
/hooks              # Custom React Hooks
/lib                # Utilities and API client
/public             # Static assets
```
